## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.  

1a. Indicate which of the following statements about React are false:

- React is a modern, efficient answer to complex UI applications - true
- React will only render on the server using Node.js - false 
- React is a full stack framework for modern web applications - false

2. What are "smart" and "dumb" components? Explain the difference and also add why we bother to make the distinction between them.

  Your answer: smart components hold all the functionality, while dumb components just display the information. We use this to have orginisation in our code.

  Researched answer: Smart Components: also know sometimes as application-level components, container components or controller components
                     Presentation Components: also known sometimes as pure components or dumb components



3. When we use "yarn add ..." in the terminal - what is yarn doing? And what file will always be automatically updated after we add a package with yarn?

  Your answer: yarn add installs the packages onto your file

  Researched answer: installs a package and any packages it depends on



4. How would you explain state to a friend who doesn't know code?

  Your answer: state is the value of the variables that you're using throughout your component.

  Researched answer:



5. What is the difference between component state and props? Your answer should include a short explanation of both.

  Your answer: componenet state is used in the parent class to pass parameters throughout the componenet. props is used to pass parameters from the parent to the child componenet

  Researched answer: In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. State on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component.
